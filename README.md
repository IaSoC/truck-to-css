# Truck to CSS - A Sort of 'Chaos Engineering' Practice

Yuki: "Driving truck to smash css is kinda of...venting emotions."

This project is a practice to RegEx, Context Recognition, and Random Generation.

## Why Smashing CSS?

...

> If you wonder.

I transfer self-harm into trashing code.

Line deletion leads to void. Adding random character to .css will just make it dysfunctional.

So, I just randomly set the switch, regenerate the color, and replace every DOM element by PRNG's wish.

## Practice

I don't decided the practice for now. But I have ideas below.

Maybe I will use jQuery for in-page JavaScript destroying,

and some high-efficiency programming language for offline trashing.

## Usage

**Remember to commit your last state in order to rollback.**

You can easily click the button on webpage, (under development)

or execute: `truck-to-css --level [number] --seed [string] sytle.css`.

After trashing and admiring, type:

```bash
git restore
```

Forget to commit? We have style.be4.css backup avaliable.

## Stacks?

I have documented some methods into docs/ folder. The answer of questions you may have, like "How the numbers match the destruction level even you type 9999999 into it?" can be found there.
